# Task 3: Image Encryption Project

## Description
This project demonstrates image encryption and decryption using Python.  
The script encrypts an image file into a binary format and can decrypt it back to the original image.

## Files
- `image_encrypt_decrypt.py`: Main Python script for encrypting and decrypting images.
- `sample.jpg`: Sample original image used for encryption.
- `encrypted_image.bin`: Encrypted binary file output.
- `decrypted_sample.jpg`: Decrypted image output.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Place your image file (e.g., `sample.jpg`) in the project directory.
3. Run the script using the command:
   python image_encrypt_decrypt.py
   4. The script will generate an encryption key â€” save it safely.
5. The encrypted and decrypted files will be created in the same directory.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- No external libraries required (or mention if you used any)
